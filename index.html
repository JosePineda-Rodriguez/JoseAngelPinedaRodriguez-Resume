        <p class="lead mb-4">I'm Jose Angel Pineda Rodriguez, currently enrolled and attending University of California Riverside, with the desire of obtaining a bachelor's degree in Business Administration and Economics. Being a student in University of California Riverside, has influenced me to pursue more accomplishments and dreams. Coming from Mexico, being able to overcome many obstacles such as social and linguistic has made me the person I am today. With this being mentioned being multilingual, being able to adapt and conquer as well being able to be supportive but at the same time being a natural born leader to guide and be impactful in whatever  challenges I take on. Some leadership has been shown when being captain of my high school tennis team, being able to lead and inspire enthusiasm as well as being able to be proactive and prepare future generations for the benefit of the tennis team. Communication is something I have achieved and tried to enforce because it allows me to portray my visions and ideas clearly as well as being multilingual has allowed me to share ideas around the world. <br><br>

        While working as an AVID tutor, in my previous high school, Valley View High School, has granted me the opportunity to work as a team, that can be considered as a family. Working along other college students preparing the future generations so they can enhance and perhaps do well in school and futurly in college, I was part of AVID through all my highschool career and it was a great opportunity to learn and discover new people as well as interest for my future and perhaps defining who I was and what perhaps I would be studying. Collaboration, communication as well as team building are some things that I do in this job without even realizing. Being able to assist and aid some students allows me to help the community as well as prepare the future generations and guide them to their success.
